Being a creator is something fascinating.

Creating programs and products and putting them out there for other people to use is an enormous pleasure.

Receiving compliments and good feedback is something wonderful.

Today, with the use of AI, this power to create has been multiplied many times over.

Ideas that used to sit in a drawer and required a lot of time to be executed can now be built in a weekend and have something functional.

Some say they have lost the joy of programming. I have only deepened my passion for creating because now I can build and execute ideas much faster.

With just a phone in hand, I can already plan and kick off a project very quickly.

What a wonderful time to be alive.
