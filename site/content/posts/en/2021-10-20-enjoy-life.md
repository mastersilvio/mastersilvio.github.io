What is living?

That's the million dollar question.

Philosophers, scientists and religious people try to answer what it is to live and what the meaning of all this is.

For many, life is working, acquiring material things and being successful. For others, it is surviving, not dying of hunger.

Life is much more than that.

The more you study and improve your life, the more priorities change.

But in the end, what matters is not the arrival but the journey, and this led me to believe that we should enjoy life and not focus only on objectives and results, but focus on what really matters.

## Carpe Diem - Seize the day

Every day, until life ends, we are given a new opportunity, a new Sun.

We must be grateful and seize the opportunity by valuing moments with family.

## Fac Vita Incrediblem - Make an incredible life

What is an incredible life?

Being prosperous and not enjoying your time?

An incredible life is one where you have three things:

### 1 - Health

Health not only by the absence of disease, but by the energy and willingness to do things.

Mental health, happiness and well-being with yourself.

### 2 - Time

There's no point in having money but not having time to enjoy it.

Those who have time have freedom and opportunity to enjoy good moments.

### 3 - Money

Money brings us freedom and the opportunity to help other people.

Money is not bad, because it buys protection, freedom and, above all, the power to say no.

## Memento Vivere

Remember that life is not just work, but enjoying the best that is given to us.

Watch the sunset, feel the wind touch your face and observe the birds.

Enjoy life!
