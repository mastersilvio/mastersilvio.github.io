We are just passing through, this is merely a crossing.

On the other side is where life truly begins.

This is what I believe when I remember those who have gone.

This is what I believe when I find myself thinking about the meaning of life.

Would it be cruel and unfair if this were all there is?

Or would life still be a privilege regardless?

My hope is to complete the journey, make the crossing, and reunite with those who have gone before.

And, one day, to wait on the other side, like a dog eagerly waiting for its owner, for those who have not yet completed their journey.
