I've always been a person who loves to calculate.

I was a math teacher for 8 years and have been a programmer for over 10 years, and my life has always been about calculating.

I always knew that what can be measured can be improved. And that we can assign a number or measurement to practically anything.

But is that really true? Can we measure everything and does everything have its value?

Even being passionate about numbers, I learned that there are things that are immeasurable.

That moments with children don't have a tangible value and it's impossible to measure them.

That people leave and the memories of lived moments are priceless.

That photos and videos once seen as unnecessary today are worth a lot.

And that happiness cannot be measured.
