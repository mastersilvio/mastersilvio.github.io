### Review and considerations about the moment of reading the book

I started reading this book right after the death of my dear father.

Until now I haven't been able to write anything about it and I'm going through the grieving process.

The little I wrote was on Instagram with photos and videos of him in special moments.

This book by C S Lewis talks about his late wife and brings reflection about grief.

One of the points that marked me the most was that he, like me, questioned God's existence and why he was going through this.

Today I'm in the hospital with my daughter in the ICU since she was born, 64 days ago.

Besides the suffering of going through this situation, I lost my father 3 weeks ago.

I know everyone goes through difficulties and some go through even greater difficulties and I know this is a process.

In the case of my father, it's a grieving process and I'm grateful for his 77 years of life and for having done so many things together.

Another interesting point in the book is about the questioning whether we will meet again the loved ones who departed.

I believe we will and that we'll be able to talk about all of this and see that this passage was something simple compared to the new reality we'll have.
