We all face that feeling of being overwhelmed when starting the work day, with a list of tasks that seems endless. However, there is a simple technique that can completely change how we face our daily challenges: the "Eat the Frog First" concept.

#### **What does "Eat the Frog First" mean?**

The phrase popularized by author Brian Tracy in his book "Eat That Frog!" is based on a quote attributed to Mark Twain: *"If the first thing you do in the morning is eat a live frog, you can spend the rest of the day knowing that the worst part is over."* The "frog" represents the most important and challenging task of your day, the one you're most likely to procrastinate on.

#### **The Power of Hard Work in the Morning**

By combining the "Eat the Frog First" concept with the principle of "Hard Work" in the morning, you amplify your performance. "Hard Work" refers to activities that require greater concentration, mental energy and intellectual effort. These are tasks that often require problem-solving, creativity or strategic decision-making.

**Why is Hard Work more effective in the morning?**

- **Peak Energy:** The brain is more alert and productive during the first hours of the day, making it easier to face complex challenges.
- **Fewer Distractions:** During the morning, there are generally fewer interruptions, allowing you to enter a state of "flow" and complete difficult tasks with greater efficiency.
- **Sense of Achievement:** Tackling the most important tasks early creates a feeling of accomplishment that motivates you for the rest of the day.

**Tips for morning Hard Work:**

1. **Wake up earlier:** Gaining an extra hour or two in the morning can be the differential to face your most challenging task.
2. **Eliminate distractions:** Keep your phone away and disable notifications to ensure total focus.
3. **Establish clear goals:** Define what you want to achieve during the "Hard Work" period to stay on track.

#### **Soft Work in the Afternoon: Slowing the Pace**

After facing the "frog" and performing your "Hard Work" in the morning, it's natural for energy and concentration capacity to decrease as the day progresses. Here comes the concept of "Soft Work": less intense activities that don't require as much mental or creative effort.

**What is Soft Work?**

Soft Work includes tasks such as answering emails, organizing documents, participating in informal meetings or doing lighter research. These activities are still productive, but don't require the same level of focus and intensity.

**Why does Soft Work work better in the afternoon?**

- **Lower energy level:** After lunch, it's common to feel an energy drop. Soft Work allows maintaining productivity without forcing the brain beyond its limit.
- **Less pressure:** Completing simpler tasks helps close the day with a sense of duty fulfilled, without requiring great mental efforts.

**Tips for afternoon Soft Work:**

1. **Organize your tasks:** Use Soft Work time to organize and plan the next day, ensuring a smooth transition to the following morning.
2. **Include breaks:** Take short breaks to recharge energy and maintain rhythm until the end of the day.
3. **Leverage light creativity:** Use this time for activities that require more open and less structured thinking, such as brainstorming or reading.

#### **Conclusion: The Balance between Hard Work and Soft Work**

Applying the "Eat the Frog First" concept along with the combination of Hard Work in the morning and Soft Work in the afternoon is a powerful approach to optimize your productivity. By focusing on the most difficult and challenging tasks during peak energy, you achieve better results and free your mind for lighter activities for the rest of the day. By understanding and respecting the natural cycles of your body and mind, you can create a work rhythm that is both effective and sustainable.

So, start the day with that "frog", put your maximum effort into "Hard Work" and allow yourself to relax and slow down with "Soft Work" as the day progresses. This combination can be the key to a more productive and satisfying routine!
