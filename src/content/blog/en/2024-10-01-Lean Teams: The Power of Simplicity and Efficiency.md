In a world where efficiency is one of the main currencies of success, many companies have chosen to operate with lean teams, maintaining focus on simplicity and effectiveness. This model, far from being a sign of lack of resources, has become a proven strategy for creating products and services that truly generate value. Let's explore the concept and analyze examples of companies that thrive with small teams.

#### **What are lean teams?**

Lean teams are those that function with a minimum number of employees, but with high productivity and impact. They are characterized by a flatter organizational structure, efficient communication and a culture of focus on results. This model promotes creativity and innovation, eliminating bureaucracies and allowing ideas to flow more quickly.

#### **Success Examples: WhatsApp, Notion and 37signals**

- **WhatsApp**: Before being acquired by Facebook, WhatsApp had only 55 employees. Even with such a small team, they were able to create and maintain a product that served more than 400 million active users. The simplicity of the team and product was what allowed WhatsApp to focus on delivering exactly what users needed: a fast, reliable and uncomplicated way to send messages.

- **Notion**: The productivity and organization tool, Notion, is also an excellent example of how a lean team can have a big impact. With about 50 employees in 2020, Notion managed to establish itself as one of the most popular platforms for project management and note-taking, all thanks to extreme focus on building a product that solves problems clearly and effectively.

- **37signals**: 37signals, which later became known as Basecamp, has always been a defender of small teams. Even having created multiple products over the years, they prioritized simplicity and avoided staff overload, focusing on what really matters for developing products that solve real customer problems. This approach allowed them to create efficient and successful products, such as Basecamp itself, which became a reference in project management.

#### **Other Companies That Thrive with Lean Teams**

- **Instagram**: Before being acquired by Facebook, Instagram had only 13 employees, but already had millions of users. The focus on interface simplicity and user experience allowed them to develop a highly desired product worldwide.

- **Basecamp**: The company behind the popular project management tool works with a team that ranges between 50 and 60 people. They adopt an intentionally lean approach, believing that a smaller team allows more direct communication and a better-built product.

- **GitLab**: GitLab is an excellent example of a company that operates with a relatively lean team, even being a global organization. They have a fully remote approach, allowing their employees to work from anywhere in the world. Even with a smaller number of collaborators compared to other technology companies, GitLab managed to develop one of the most popular DevOps platforms on the market, thanks to its culture of documentation, efficiency and collaboration.

- **Toggl**: Known for its time tracking tool, Toggl has a lean and fully remote team. With a focus on creating a simple and easy-to-use product, they were able to compete with major market players, delivering an effective solution for freelancers, agencies and teams of all sizes. Their success is a reflection of a highly focused and motivated team.

- **Superhuman**: The email client Superhuman, which promises to offer the fastest email experience in the world, also operates with a lean team. Even receiving significant investments, the company preferred to maintain a small and highly qualified team, focusing on creating a product that truly revolutionized the email experience, rather than rapidly expanding the workforce.

- **DuckDuckGo**: DuckDuckGo, the search engine that prioritizes privacy, is another example of success with lean teams. They managed to build a solid product and capture a considerable slice of the online search market, even competing with giants like Google. With a team that was initially composed of just a few dozen people, the company managed to create and maintain an efficient and respectable search engine.

#### **How to apply the lean philosophy to your team**

1. **Hire only what is essential**: Focus on finding people who are highly competent and motivated. Instead of hiring by volume, seek talents that complement existing skills in the team.

2. **Focus on results, not hours**: A lean team is driven by clear objectives and tangible results, not by long work hours. Defining clear goals and success metrics can help maintain focus and efficiency.

3. **Automate and optimize processes**: Automation tools and technologies like GitLab, which simplify developer workflows, can significantly reduce the time and effort needed to complete tasks.

4. **Adopt a continuous improvement mindset**: Lean teams need to always be looking for ways to improve processes and products, keeping simplicity in mind.

#### **Conclusion**

Lean teams prove that, in many cases, "less is more". By maintaining focus on simplicity and efficiency, companies like WhatsApp, Notion, 37signals, Instagram, Basecamp, GitLab, Toggl, Superhuman and DuckDuckGo showed that it's possible to deliver products of very high value with a relatively small number of employees. The key is to invest in exceptional talents, create a culture of accountability and maintain focus on what really matters: solving problems effectively and delivering value to the customer.
