## What is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is an emerging approach to programming that uses large language models (LLMs) to generate code from natural-language instructions. This lets developers, even without deep technical knowledge, build applications by describing desired features, delegating the coding to AI.

The term was coined by **Andrej Karpathy**, OpenAI co-founder and former Tesla AI director, in February 2025. Karpathy described this approach as useful for quick projects or prototypes, acknowledging AI may not understand or fix every bug, requiring user experimentation.

## Popular Tools

Several tools have been used to facilitate vibe coding:

- **Cursor**: An integrated development environment (IDE) that integrates AI to assist code generation.
- **Windsurf**: Backend-focused with AI support.
- **Replit**: Online platform for collaborative coding with AI assistance.
- **Lovable**: Beginner-friendly interface for AI-assisted development.

## Impact on Startups

Vibe coding has enabled startups to operate with smaller teams, maintaining high productivity. Garry Tan, Y Combinator CEO, observed companies can reach significant revenue with lean teams thanks to AI-powered automation.

## Considerations and Limitations

Despite the advantages, vibe coding presents challenges:

- **Code Understanding**: Developers may not fully grasp generated code.
- **Security**: Lack of understanding can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **Code Quality**: AI may introduce bugs or poor practices.
