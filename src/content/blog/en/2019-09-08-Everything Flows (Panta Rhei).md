No one steps into the same river twice, for when that happens, one is no longer the same, just as the waters are now different.

This was formulated by one of my favorite philosophers named Heraclitus of Ephesus, and he is the thinker of Panta Rhei (everything flows), meaning everything changes.

Everything is in constant change and evolution, nothing stays the same. There's no point in wanting to return to the past to try to relive something, because those are bygone waters. There's no point in wanting to always be the same person, always do the same things, everything changes. There's no point in stubbornly clinging to things, because they are finite and will soon pass.

Nothing is permanent except change.

"The most important and beautiful thing in the world is this: that people are not always the same, they have not yet been finished - but they are always changing. They tune or detune, greater truth. This is what life taught me." - Guimarães Rosa.

We need to have this mindset and always try to evolve in all aspects of our lives and understand that nothing is stable, everything has an end and everything is in constant change.

This is the beauty of life, if everything were always the same, what would be the point?

The good thing is to change, grow, learn, unlearn and learn again. The good thing is to live and flow.

In the future, I will read this and I will be someone else, and so will you.
