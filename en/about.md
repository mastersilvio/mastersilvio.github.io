I hold a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and have been passionate about Mathematics and Programming from an early age.

My career has always been driven by solving complex problems, leveraging algorithms, logical thinking, and data-driven decision making. I have worked as a Mathematics and Robotics teacher, an experience that strengthened my foundation in logic, systems, automation, and technical education.

Currently, I am specializing as a Machine Learning Engineer, deepening my expertise in modeling, data, intelligent automation, and building systems that learn and evolve over time.

I have an entrepreneurial mindset — I enjoy turning real problems into practical solutions, creating products, structuring processes, and building technology with concrete impact on business and people's lives. I move fluidly between engineering, data, product, and operations — from idea to algorithm, from experiment to result.

I am self-taught, driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and the constant pursuit of growth, change, and new challenges.
