> "What you think determines the quality of your mind.
> **Your soul takes on the color of your thoughts.**"
> — Marcus Aurelius (Meditations 5.16)

At one phase of my life, I adopted extremely positive thinking — and the results were excellent in various areas.
It seemed like a superpower: one way or another, everything worked out.

In another phase, I was more realistic, with my feet on the ground. But, curiously, the results I got weren't as good as I expected.

Given these two scenarios, the question arises:

**Does this prove the "Law of Attraction"?**
Is it enough for someone, somewhere in Africa, to think positively for their entire reality to change overnight?

**Obviously not.**
But there's something undeniable: **the way we think shapes our behavior — and, consequently, our life.**

Thinking positively **is healthy for the brain.**
It makes us more proactive, confident and open to opportunities. And it's this change in attitude that often generates good results.

Everything starts in the mind:

- **What we think, we feel.**
- **What we feel, we act.**
- **And the way we act determines the results we reap.**

And you? Have you noticed how your thinking directly influences your results?
