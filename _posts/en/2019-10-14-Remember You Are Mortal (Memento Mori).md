It's hard to think that one day we will die. It's hard to live thinking that one day we will no longer be here.

For many, this is madness, living thinking about death is being pessimistic and macabre.

But one thing is certain: we will all die one day. With each passing day, our time is running out.

Memento Mori is a Latin expression that means: remember that you are mortal. In other words, there's no point in being vain, proud, and thinking you will live forever. This is everyone's end. Our time is finite and very limited.

"Many men cling and hold on to life, just like those who are carried away by a current and cling and hold on to sharp rocks. Most men wither and flow in misery between the fear of death and the difficulties of life; they are not willing to live, and yet do not know how to die." - Seneca

"It is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting, for where there is mourning we remember that one day we too will die. And the living should never forget this." - Ecclesiastes 7:2 NTLH

Live your day as if it were your last, hug your parents, hold your children, tell your wife you love her. Live in the present, forget the past and stop thinking so much about the future.
